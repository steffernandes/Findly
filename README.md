<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Findly is a mobile app developed in my second semester of the first year of my degree in Design and Technologies of Mobile Apps

As someone who enjoys watching movies and tv shows I often spend more time searching for something new to see than actually watching it. I wanted to create a fast and easy way to get recommendations on what to watch according to what I was in the mood to see and have an option to save the recommendations for later.
